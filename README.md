# QuimP_to_AmoePy_bridge
Simple notebok for converting QuimP segmented cell contours to a format that can be imported into Amoepy for downstream analysis of cell morphology over time.


# TODO
- Write instructions to get the sname.csv file from QuimP
- Write instructions to run notebook
- Make notebook available on Colab (?)
- Add a description of the different snake data types
- Add example snake.csv file for testing
- Add option to run on entire directory and save each file individually (?)
